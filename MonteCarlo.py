# MonteCarlo.py
# This program uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the probability of winning the dice game "Approach" with different
# "hold" values.
# Recall that approach works like this:
# Both players agree on a limit n.
# Player 1 rolls first. They go until they either exceed n or hold.
# Then player 2 rolls. They go until they either exceed n or beat player 1's score.
# The player who is closest to n without going over wins.
# Note:
# We can reduce this to the problem of player 1 choosing the best value at which to hold.
# This is called a policy; once we know the best number to hold at, we can act optimally.

# To estimate the best number to hold at, we'll try to estimate the probability of winning
# for each possible hold value between n-5 and n.
# Once we have this, we will know which hold value to use for our strategy.

# This function should try each possible hold value 1000000 times. For each time, play a random
# game. If Player 1 wins, increment the appropriate value in the win_table dictionary.

# n is the limit.
